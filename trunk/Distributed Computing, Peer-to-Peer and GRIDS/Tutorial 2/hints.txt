1. The segments should be downloaded before their playback time.
2. When a peer has some potential providers for one segment, it should
consider the upload bandwidth of them to select the more appropriate
peer as provider.
3. If a peer can not download all the segments before their playback
time, the number of missed segment should be minimized (averagely 2% for
whole peers not each peer; one may miss more than 2% and one may miss
less).


------------------------------



1- Prioritize asking for the segments close to their deadline, so that you can have them in-time
2- Ask for several segments in parallel
3- Do not forget the nice properties of randomness, do not think too complicated. The whole universe relies on randomness, why not you ;-)
